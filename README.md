## Project Overview

**SugarSage** is a machine learning-powered application aimed at predicting diabetes risk based on key patient attributes. Its focus is to provide insights to individuals and healthcare professionals, fostering proactive and informed decision-making.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **Age**: Represents the patient's age in years. Age is a significant risk factor for diabetes, as risk increases with age.
- **Gender**: Indicates the patient's gender, which may influence diabetes risk.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A measure based on height and weight to classify weight categories. Higher BMI correlates with higher diabetes risk.
- **Chol (Cholesterol)**: Total cholesterol level in the blood. High cholesterol is a risk factor for diabetes and heart disease.
- **TG (Triglycerides)**: Blood triglyceride levels. Elevated levels increase risk of heart disease and diabetes.
- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)**: "Good" cholesterol that removes excess cholesterol. Higher HDL levels are beneficial.
- **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**: "Bad" cholesterol that contributes to artery plaque buildup, increasing diabetes risk.
- **Cr (Creatinine)**: Indicates kidney function. Kidney disease may be linked to diabetes risk.
- **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**: Reflects kidney and liver function. Abnormal levels may signal disorders related to diabetes.
- **Diagnosis**: Indicates whether a patient has diabetes.

## Objectives

- Predict diabetes risk based on demographic and health data.
- Analyze the impact of each attribute on diabetes prediction.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for exploring prediction results.
